# Unlisted Rimworld Mods
 Where all the unlisted mods go, mostly when I'm out of patience for dealing with users who can't take "Fuck off" as an answer.
 
 Manual install is real fucking simple, just extract the folder from the zip and put it into the Rimworld/Mods directory.
 
 They're organised by Rimworld version, then mod series if they were part of one.
