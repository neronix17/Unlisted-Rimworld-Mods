# Unlisted Rimworld Mods
 Where all the unlisted mods go, mostly when I'm out of patience for dealing with users who can't take "Fuck off" as an answer. Another case being when I make an unofficial update of another authors mod, I do it for myself and don't support it more than that but can't hurt to put it out there. Basically, if you have an issue, tough, I'm not going to fix it.
 
 Manual install is real fucking simple, just extract the folder from the zip and put it into the Rimworld/Mods directory.
 
 They're organised by Rimworld version, then mod series if they were part of one.
